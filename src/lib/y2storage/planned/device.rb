    # Abstract base class for the different devices templates in the
    # Planned namespace.
    #
    # Most classes in the {Planned} namespace represent an specification
    # of a given device that must be created in a devicegraph (thus, finally in
    # the system) by the storage proposal or by AutoYaST. That specification is,
    # of course, less concrete than the real device object.
    #
    # Those templates clases inherit from this and implement most of the
    # functionality and properties by composition, including several of the
    # mixins defined in the {Planned} namespace.
    #
    # FIXME: having separate setters for reuse_name and reuse_sid is dangerous
    # and makes some parts of the code cumbersome.
    # We need to fix this class to ensure they are in sync but adapting the mocks in
    # the test cases was too much work.
